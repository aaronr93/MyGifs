# MyGifs
iOS application for curating your own gif sources.

## Features

- View a user's collection of gifs from Gfycat.com (user selection coming soon)

## Roadmap

1. Tap a gif to copy its URL to they clipboard
2. Send gifs via iMessage with iMessages App and iMessages Extension (requires restructuring the existing logic into a Framework)
3. View a user's public albums of gifs on Imgur
